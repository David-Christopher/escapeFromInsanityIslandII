B4 You walk into the jungle.
These logs look perfect for
building a raft. If you have a
saw, you can cut down the
logs. The trees are shorter so
you can only cut short
sections. If you have a saw,
you cut them down. If not,
keep your eyes open for a saw.

Do you cut a log?

Press Y to take.
Press N to leave.

(You can return here to cut 
down more logs if needed.)
