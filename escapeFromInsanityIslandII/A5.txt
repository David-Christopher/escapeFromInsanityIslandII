A5 Find a rock-pool with
trapped fish during low tide.
If you have the spear, you are
able to spear them and have
sushi for your meal today. If
you donâ€™t have a spear, keep
looking out for one. If you
find one you can return later
to get some fish. This is a
great place for fishing during
low tide.

If you have a spear,
do you catch fish?
