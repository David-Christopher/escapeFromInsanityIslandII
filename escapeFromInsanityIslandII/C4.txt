C4 You walk into the jungle.
These logs look perfect for
building a raft. If you have a
saw, you can cut down the
logs. The trees are longer so
you can cut long sections of
logs. If you have a saw, you
can cut them down.

Do you cut down a log?

Press Y to take.
Press N to leave.

(You can return here to cut 
down more logs if required.)
